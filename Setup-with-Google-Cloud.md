# Setting up with Google Cloud

We can use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to run our Kubernetes cluster. Google Cloud has a *free tier*, which allows us to run a cluster for free - so long as we turn it off when the workshop ends.

### Signing up for Google Cloud

To sign up for Google Cloud Platform Trial (which includes *300.00 AUD* of credit), simply use your *Gmail* account to sign up using the form at: [https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial)

The trial may prompt you for credit card info - don't worry, we won't be billed if we clean up!

### Setting up a Project

Once you're signed up, we can create our project as follows:

1. From the top menu bar, click:

![Create New Prject](images/11-new-project.png)


2. From the top-right, click:

![Create New Prject](images/11-new-project-1.png)


3. Set up your new project as follows:

Once we select a project, it should start the Kubernetes Engine API. To see this, visit the [Kubernetes engine page](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/kubernetes) in the Google Cloud console.

This will take some time - so grab a coffee, relax, and get ready! ☕️

Once this finishes, click on the Google Console button on the top-right of the page. This will enable a web console on the bottom of your screen - where you can type commands to interface with both *Google Cloud* and *Kubernetes*!

You're up and running when the console looks like this:

On the console, let's set our region. For this workshop, we'll be using `australia-southeast1`:

```
gcloud config set compute/zone australia-southeast1-a
```

After this, all we need to do is create a cluster. 

### Setting up a Cluster


Type in the following command to create a single-node cluster called `devops-rep` (Feel free to use any cluster name!):

```
gcloud container clusters create devops-rep --num-nodes=1
```
You'll see the following:

`Creating cluster devops-rep in australia-southeast1-a... Cluster is being health-checked...`

Like the previous steps, this may take some time - so maybe make another cup of tea. ☕️

You'll see the Google Cloud console doing a couple of things (which we'll talk about shortly). 

When it finishes, you'll see this:

![Cluster created](images/11-cluster-created.png)



Once it finishes, the only command left to run is to get the credentials to the cluster:

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials devops-rep
```

Where `devops-rep` is what you called your cluster. And now you're done and you should see lines like this in your console!

After you've setup an environment with Docker and Kubernetes, you're going to need some files from this repository for parts of this workshop. Make sure you clone the workshop in your Google Web Console:

```
git clone https://github.com/DevOps-Represent/kubernetes-101.git
cd kubernetes-101
```

If you get the following error when creating your cluster:

`ERROR: (gcloud.container.clusters.create) ResponseError: code=500, message=Internal error encountered.`

Try the following:
- Make sure you're in the correct Project
